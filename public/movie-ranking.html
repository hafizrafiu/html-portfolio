<h2>Let's walk you through my top movies of all time!</h2>

<ol>
<li><h3>The Founder</h3></li>
<p>The movie is an amazing eye opener for struggling and visionary youths. Personally, I found it more intriguing because it's quite unimaginable for me.
I mean... such a successful franchise went global by the creativity and foresight of a struggling sales person.  
</p>
<li><h3>The Wolf of Wall street</h3></li>
<p>This movie is a force to reckon with any time! "From grass to grace" is always a thing to motivate small scale entrepreneurs, startup business merchants,
 sales persons etc. that are bound to experience failures and rejections before they can possibly achieve their goals. And this movie right here, did just that!</p>
<li><h3>The Social Network</h3></li>
<p>I just love this movie because it's telling a story and it really took us back in time. I now feel like I knew when Facebook was created,lol.
I actually loved this also because it teaches a lesson which is: If you are starting a business with a partner, ensure you both have like-minds or matching energy
towards the growth and success of the business.
